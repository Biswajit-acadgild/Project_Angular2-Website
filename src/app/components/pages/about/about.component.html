It mentions that India has quite good air transport (ranked 35th), particularly given the countryâ€™s stage of development, and reasonable ground transport infrastructure (ranked 50th). The country also scores high on natural and cultural resources (ranked 12th).[10] Some other aspects of its tourism infrastructure remain somewhat underdeveloped however.
